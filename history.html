			<p>The National Animal Rights Day (NARD) was established in New York City in 2011, by a group of animal rights activists who came together under the name <a href='http://www.ourplanettheirstoo.org/'><b>&#34;Our Planet. Theirs Too.&#34;</b></a>, with the vision of uniting the many animal rights and environmental groups in the city, for a common cause: To give a voice to the billions of animals who languish and die in the US each year by human hands; reiterate their rights to live happy and free; mourn their loss and its adverse impact on them, the environment, and human health; and celebrate the progress being made towards changing this sad reality. This vision was guided by the collborative and impactful work of the Spanish animal rights organization <a href='http://www.igualdadanimal.org/'><b>Igualdad Animal</b></a>, and its mass public events on the International Animal Rights Day.</p>
			<p>While it didn&#39;t create a new and lasting model of collaboration in the animal rights movement in NYC, the event started the tradition of the annual NARD, and exposed the public to the cause of animal rights in a new and powerful way. The day started with a requiem ceremony for the billions of animals who die each year in the US by human hands, and then proceded with the unveiling and signing of the Declaration of Animal Rights, which was created by the organizers especially for the event and mounted on a large paper scroll. It then ended with a celebration that included info tables from 30 animal rights and planet protection organizations, vegan food, live music, speakers, raffle and more.</p>
			<p>NARD2 was organized again by <b>&#34;Our Planet. Theirs Too.&#34;</b></a> in NYC on June 5 2012. It had fewer animal rights groups participating, but its public outreach was stronger and wider than the first year&#39;s event. It started again with a requiem ceremony for the animals, continued with the signing of the Declaration of Animal Rights (which by now was a 50 foot long paper scroll with hundreds of signatures on it), and ended with a festival of info tables, vegan food, yoga, live music, speakers, street theatre, and capoeira and dance performances.</p>
			<p>NARD3, celebrated on Sunday June 9th 2013, saw the expansion of the National Animal Rights Day to another city outside New York: Los Angeles. Organized again by <b>&#34;Our Planet. Theirs Too.&#34;</b></a> in NYC and LA, in collaboration with the LA-based <a href='http://www.aprl.org/'><b>Animal Protection and Rescue League</b></a> (APRL) and <a href='http://expandanimalrightsnow.org/'><b>Expand Animal Rights Now</b></a> (EARN), the day took a historic leap forward with its bi-coastal events, and the LA special opening ceremony &#45; the first of its kind in the US &#45; incorporating the bodies of deceased animals, as has been done on the International Animal Rights Day by <a href='http://www.igualdadanimal.org/'><b>Igualdad Animal</b></a> in Spain, and other animal rights groups in Australia, Austria, and Israel.</p>
